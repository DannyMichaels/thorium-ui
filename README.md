# Overview
The goal of Throium-UI is to provide an intuitive, user-friendly API with which to build React components, without needing a ton of CSS clutter. This does not mean, however, that you are stuck with the default styling baked into Thorium-UI. Either providing values to the style prop, or styling via CSS will override the built-in styling of any component.

# Getting Started
## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository and copy the Thorium-UI file to the `/src` directory of your React project.

## Setting up your App component
Once the Thorium-UI source file is in your project, we need to do some very minimal boilerplate to get things up and running. Start by including the ThoriumRoot component in the return statement of your App (or the render method, if using a class-based App component).

When using ThroiumRoot, you must pass it either a dark or light prop. This will set the default theme to use (this can always be toggled later inside your components).

Your App.js file should look like this.

```
import React from "react";
import ThoriumRoot from "../Thorium-UI/ThoriumRoot";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThoriumRoot dark>
      /* YOUR Code HERE */
    </ThoriumRoot>
  );
};
export default App;
```

You're now ready to begin using Thorium components!
